Our Presidential ticket tripled previous records, our party has ballot access in more states after a Presidential election than ever before, and we’re getting ballot access back in places like Ohio.  We’ve added staff to improve development, media relations, and candidate recruitment and support, in addition to the affiliate support efforts started during my first term as Chair.  More elected officials from the old parties are defecting to the Libertarian Party than we’ve seen in over a decade. It would be my honor if you would re-elect me to continue growing our party at the national convention in New Orleans.</div>

Since July 2014, I have served as Chairman of the Libertarian National Committee.</div>

He is one of the people that makes me excited to continue to volunteer for the party even after almost 20 years of helping out. He makes me proud when he is on stage in front of two people or doing an interview on CNN in front of a million people. I know he is going to do what is best for the party at all times even when it is not easy. He is going to give your fair shot even if you disagree with him. He is the kind of leader that makes me proud to be a card carrying Libertarian. Nicholas Sarwark has earned my support. If you are in NOLA over the Independence Day convention please give him your support. </p>

His drive, determination and dedication have always been the most admirable qualities to me.  Approximately 5 days after I found out I was pregnant with our third child, he asked what I thought about him running for LNC Chair. Of course I was nervous about the time commitment and impact on our family but I encouraged him to do it. By day, my husband and my children's father helps run his family's 74-year old business. By night, he is an amazing father and loving husband, all the while doing interviews, attending meetings, answering emails, fighting for freedom and taking time to help the LP in any way he can. Sure, weekends can be challenging when you've got a 5, 4 and 1 year old but Nick will answer a FaceTime almost any time and we are all so proud of the hard, and oftentimes thankless work he puts in to make sure these babies have a more free future. I'm not just proud of my husband, I'm encouraged by him and I know I'm not alone.</p>

                                            <p class="white-text">Prior to 2014 I knew Nick Sarwark only as the calming voice of reason that I would hear coming from the floor of National Conventions.  His speech for NOTA in 2012 brought about a major turning point that began to reform the LNC committee structure for the better.  Nick's leadership has continued those improvements. Most notable and appreciated by me is the complete transparency of LNC business that Nick maintains.  Members are able to watch the quarterly LNC meetings via live-stream and read their District Reps e-mail communications openly on the business list.  Nick makes himself available to questions from members and prepares amazing articles that keep the LP prominently in the news. Nick has been the best and most public face of the party in my 12 years of membership. I hope you will join me in voting for Nick Sarwark in Orlando to ensure a continuity of leadership during this important election year and to continue the professionalism and respectability that the Libertarian Party has gained under Nick's watch.</p>
