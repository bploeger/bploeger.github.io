                                            <p class="white-text">When I met Nick, he was the Chair of the MDLP, working as a full time software engineer and attending law school at night.  His drive, determination and dedication have always been the most admirable qualities to me.  Approximately 5 days after I found out I was pregnant with our third child, he asked what I thought about him running for LNC Chair. Of course I was nervous about the time commitment and impact on our family but I encouraged him to do it. By day, my husband and my children's father helps run his family's 74-year old business. By night, he is an amazing father and loving husband, all the while doing interviews, attending meetings, answering emails, fighting for freedom and taking time to help the LP in any way he can. Sure, weekends can be challenging when you've got a 5, 4 and 1 year old but Nick will answer a FaceTime almost any time and we are all so proud of the hard, and oftentimes thankless work he puts in to make sure these babies have a more free future. I'm not just proud of my husband, I'm encouraged by him and I know I'm not alone.</p>

                                            <p class="white-text">Prior to 2014 I knew Nick Sarwark only as the calming voice of reason that I would hear coming from the floor of National Conventions.  His speech for NOTA in 2012 brought about a major turning point that began to reform the LNC committee structure for the better.  Nick's leadership has continued those improvements. Most notable and appreciated by me is the complete transparency of LNC business that Nick maintains.  Members are able to watch the quarterly LNC meetings via live-stream and read their District Reps e-mail communications openly on the business list.  Nick makes himself available to questions from members and prepares amazing articles that keep the LP prominently in the news. Nick has been the best and most public face of the party in my 12 years of membership. I hope you will join me in voting for Nick Sarwark in Orlando to ensure a continuity of leadership during this important election year and to continue the professionalism and respectability that the Libertarian Party has gained under Nick's watch.</p>
